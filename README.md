# Chant tones and Guitar Accompaniment for Lauds and Vespers

...

## Overview

Typesetting will be done with _LilyPond_ for Modern Standard notation and with _Gregorio_ for Gregorian notation.

Attempts were made to use LilyPond for both, but it's quite painful to work with square notes in LY syntax. Gregorio and GABC are purpose-built to handle this use case, so we'll be faster and more efficient with it.
